## Overview

The function leaflet() returns a Leaflet map widget, which stores a list of objects that can be modified or updated later. Most functions in this package have an argument map as their first argument, which makes it easy to use the pipe operator %>% in the magrittr package. The leaflet widget focuses on introducing new leaflet users to playing with adding colors and polygons to maps.
